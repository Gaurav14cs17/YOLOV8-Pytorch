# YOLOv8-RepNeXt

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to this PyTorch implementation of **YOLOv8** powered by the **RepNeXt architecture**. If you're looking for a fast, accurate object detection model that's easy to train and deploy, you're in the right place.

This project is inspired by the [RepNeXt paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16004) — a clever approach that uses multiple convolutional branches during training but fuses them into a single efficient layer at inference time. The result? You get the best of both worlds: rich feature learning during training and blazing-fast inference.

## What Makes This Special?

The magic lies in **structural reparameterization**. Here's the idea in plain terms:

- **During training**, the model uses 5 parallel branches (7×7, 5×5, 3×3, 1×1, and identity) to capture features at different scales
- **During inference**, all those branches get mathematically fused into a single 7×7 convolution
- **The result**: Same accuracy, way faster inference — no tricks, just math!

## RepNeXt Block — The Core Innovation

The RepNeXt block is where the magic happens. During training, it uses multiple parallel branches to learn rich features:

### How Reparameterization Works

At inference time, all those branches are mathematically fused into a single convolution. No accuracy loss, just pure speed:

## CSP Block Design

We use Cross Stage Partial (CSP) blocks with RepNeXt for better gradient flow and reduced computation:

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gaurav14cs17/YOLOV8-Pytorch.git
cd YOLOV8-Pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Your First Model

Creating a model is straightforward:

```python
from model import yolo_v8_n, yolo_v8_s, yolo_v8_m

# Pick the size that fits your needs
model = yolo_v8_n(num_classes=80)   # Nano - fastest, good for edge devices
model = yolo_v8_s(num_classes=80)   # Small - nice balance
model = yolo_v8_m(num_classes=80)   # Medium - when you need more accuracy

# Test it out
import torch
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 640, 640)
outputs = model(x)
```

### Speed Up Inference

Before deploying, reparameterize the model to fuse all branches:

```python
model.eval()
model.reparameterize()

# Now it's faster!
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(x)
```

## Training Your Own Model

### Standard Training

```bash
python train.py --train --epochs 100 --batch-size 16 --input-size 640
```

### Quantization-Aware Training

Want to deploy on edge devices? Use QAT for better performance on limited hardware:

```bash
python qtrain.py --train --epochs 20 --batch-size 32
```

Training outputs are saved to different folders:
- Standard training → `weights/`
- Quantized training → `weights_quant/`

### Dataset Setup

Organize your data in YOLO format:

```
dataset/
├── images/
│   ├── train/
│   └── val/
└── labels/
    ├── train/
    └── val/
```

Each label file should have one line per object:
```
class_id x_center y_center width height
```
All coordinates are normalized to 0-1.

## Running Inference

### Standard Model

```bash
python inference.py \
    --weights weights/best.pt \
    --source path/to/image.jpg \
    --conf-thres 0.25 \
    --iou-thres 0.45 \
    --save
```

### Quantized Model

```bash
python qinference.py \
    --weights weights_quant/best.pt \
    --source path/to/image.jpg \
    --conf-thres 0.25 \
    --save
```

## Model Variants

Choose based on your speed/accuracy tradeoff:

| Variant | Parameters | Use Case |
|---------|------------|----------|
| nano | ~3M | Edge devices, real-time on CPU |
| tiny | ~5M | Mobile devices |
| small | ~11M | Good balance for most cases |
| medium | ~26M | When accuracy matters more |
| large | ~44M | High accuracy applications |
| xlarge | ~68M | Maximum accuracy |

---
